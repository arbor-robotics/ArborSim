# ROS communication

## The map origin

We set ROS's `map` frame origin to be the pose of the [Discobulus statue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discobolus), which must be named `MapFrameOrigin` in the scene. Move the statue and you move the entire origin of the map, along with everything that's anchored by it. Note that the statue is intentionally pink.
